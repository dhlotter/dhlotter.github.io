To keep momentum and visualize my progress, I track my monthly nett worth and over the years my strategy has evolved to something fairly passive which doesn't require a lot of thinking anymore. Therefor, most of what I own is in ETF's and looks like this:


**Emergency Fund** 
* â€‹Bond - 6 months living expenses

**Easy Equities - Tax Free Savings Account** 
* Sygnia Itrix MSCI World ETF

**Retirement** 
* Momentum Investo Retirement Annuity
* Investec iSelect Preservation Pension Plan
* Investec iSelect Preservation Provident Fund

**Other**
* Seapoint Property 

**Easy Equities - General Share Trading Account**
