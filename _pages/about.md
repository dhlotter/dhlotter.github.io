Hey, I'm Hermann. 
I currently live in the beautiful Cape Town, South Africa. I work in the [financial services industry](https://www.kurtosys.com/) as a Database Administrator where I get challenged and stretched on a daily basis. Automation fuels me and I love making things easier... 

To fill the gaps I keep myself busy with personal projects. This could be anything from Hydroponics to restoring old Jeeps and rebuilding motorcycles. This is my journal, mostly so I can learn from my mistakes. 

**Projects**

* [1996 Jeep Cherokee Build](/projects/1996-jeep-cherokee-build) 
* [1986 BMW R80 Build](/projects/1986-bmw-r80) 

**Maintenance**
