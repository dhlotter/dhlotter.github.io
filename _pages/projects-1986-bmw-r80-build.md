start putting this together. 
what need to happen?

tell the story. 
was looking for an R80RT monolever for a while
finally found one. was so out of it i couldnt drive a bike any more and took a friend a long to test drive ti for me. decided to buy it. registration and transfer was  breeze. 

drove it around for a while getting my feels back. 
gave it a clean the one day and started plotting what the bike would look like. problem was, the longer i waited and the more i planned, the more my plans changed. i had a rough idea of what the bike would look like and started going at it. 

and just when i thought i settled on a look, on a whim i bought a suzuki tl1000s front end, had it retro fitted to the beamer front wheel. the triple trees came out looking like a children drawing and i contact Ian Ketterer at Black Silver Customs to help me make another pair. We worked on the design, he sent me some sketches, i liked it and we sent it for waterjetting. 

at this point i recieved most of the handleparts. hello motogadget and goodbye savings. 
[add pictures of the parts]

my tools started getting more and everytime it took longer and longer to get the bits i was looking for. it was time for a change and i decided to treat myself. got this and from now on reaching for a tool is just rolling over and opening a drawer. 

started stripping the bike
had to figure what i will be doing when it comes to the seat before i could continue. as part of this i had to learn how to weld. here's some of the pictures. go ahead, have a laugh. but it got better. 

found flapping disks and had some fun with that.
