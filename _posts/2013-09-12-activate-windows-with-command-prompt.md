I cannot tell you how many times I end up formatting my notebook. Eventually something always goes wrong and the prospect of troubleshooting seems way more daunting than a quick format. Besides, most of my information on the notebook is in the cloud, so I install the OS followed by a quick visit to [Ninite](http://ninite.com/) (a super service you should be using ), and then when Google drive installed, the wait begin for my files to re-download. Luckily some of us work for one of the largest ISP's in South Africa and down 
bandwidth is not a problem. 

Back to the reason for this post...

Once Windows 8 installed you can change the key and activate it as follows: 

Do the following. 
* Start an elevate command prompt and change working directory to System32 directory. 

> cd %WINDIR%\system32 

* Clear any KMS entries you may have. 

> slmgr.vbs –ckms

Rejoice! Your operating system (Windows 8 / Windows Server) should now be activated.
