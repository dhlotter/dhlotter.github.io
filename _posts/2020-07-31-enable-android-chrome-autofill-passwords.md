I don't know about you, but the current autofill passwords for Chrome on Android has been sketchy and did not work consistently as I would have liked it to. If you feel the same, there is some good news, you can now enable "Touch To Fill UI for Passwords" on Chrome Android. Todo this, to the following:

1. On your Android open Chrome
2. Navigate to **chrome://flags**
3. Find or search for **"Touch To Fill UI for Passwords"**
4. Change to **"Enabled"**
5. Restart Chrome
